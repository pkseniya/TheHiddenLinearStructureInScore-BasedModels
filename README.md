# The Hidden Linear Structure in Score-Based Models and its Application

## Discription of our project

In our project we recreated methods described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10892.pdf) about accelerating sampling process from diffusion models. 
Score-based models have achieved remarkable results in the generative modeling of many domains. 
By learning the gradient of smoothed data distribution, we can iteratively generate samples from complex distribution e.g. natural images. 
However, is there any universal structure in the gradient field that will eventually be learned by any neural network? 
In the paper the authors aim to find such structures through a normative analysis of the score function. 
First, they derived the closed-form solution to the scored-based model with a Gaussian score. 
The authors claimed that for well-trained diffusion models, the learned score at a high noise scale is well approximated by the linear score of Gaussian. 
They demonstrated this through empirical validation of pre-trained images diffusion model and theoretical analysis of the score function. 
Their finding of the linear structure in the score-based model has implications for better model design and data pre-processing.



## Getting started

To reproduce the main results from the paper run:

1. Obtain $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ for CIFAR10 dataset using
```
python linear_structure/get_parameters.py CIFAR10 gaussian gaussian_params
```
2. Calculate the FID score for the various numbers of steps skipped using analytical teleportation by running
```
bash run_experiments_with_skips.sh
```
3. Process the results of the calculations and get a graph of the dependence of the FID on the number of skipped steps with
```
python process_experiments_with_skips.py
```
4. Additionally you can compare approximation error between neural score and analytical scores (isotropic and gaussian):
```
bash run_plot_scores.sh
```
